The Toast Notification is a web-based component that displays non-intrusive messages to users. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the notification appears as a small pop-up box at the bottom or top of the screen. Users receive brief messages or alerts, such as confirmation messages, error notifications, or status updates. JavaScript handles the timing and animation of the notification, allowing it to appear and disappear smoothly. This component enhances user experience by providing important information without interrupting their workflow.
